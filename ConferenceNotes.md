# Conference Notes
## FEM Rodeo 2015
### Tan Bui-Thanh Talk
From Godunov to a Unified HDG Framework
HDG Methods for Shallow Water Equations
From Rankine-Hugoniot to a Unified HDG Framework
Phrase DPG as a unified finite element computing framework

## Thoughts for Sandia
Guermond's work:
    Entropy viscosity
    Flux corrected transport
Phase-field modeling
HDG
IMEX
Automatic differentiation
L1 DPG + NURBS = less internal oscillations?

# Important Features in a Numerical Method
Stability
Low diffusion
High order
Adaptivity
Local computation
Multiphysics

# Texas A&M
Brinkman equation with DPG 
Stokes with epsilon=1, Darcy with epsilon=0
(classical methods are stable for one or the other)


## USNCCM 2015
Euler Vortex problem
