Initial mesh design for computational fluid dynamics can be a time-consuming and expensive process. 
The stability properties and nonlinear convergence of most numerical methods rely on a minimum level of mesh resolution. 
This means that unless the initial computational mesh is fine enough, convergence can not be guaranteed. 
Any meshes below this minimum resolution level are termed to be in the ``pre-asymptotic regime.'' 
This condition implies that meshes need to in some way anticipate the solution before it is known. 
On top of the minimum requirement that the surface meshes must adequately represent the geometry of the problem under consideration, 
resolution requirements on the volume mesh make the CFD practitioner's job significantly more time consuming. 
% This is not to mention auxiliary requirements from turbulence models needed to accurately resolve boundary layers. 
% Thus, mesh design and simulation become an iterative trial and error process.
% A common process is for an engineer to study the problem at hand and attempt to predict regions that require extra resolution. 
% Then they will spend hours coaxing the mesher to produce an adequate mesh before importing the mesh into the solver.
% Too often, the solver will fail to converge on the given mesh due to some unforeseen mesh inadequacy on part of the solution domain.
% The engineer then needs to descend back into the mesher to fix the problem elements.
% This process is repeated until the solver is satisfied and convergence can be reached.
% This iterative trial and error is undesirable while working on personal computers or modestly sized compute clusters, 
% but becomes increasing costly as the problem is scaled up to the tens or hundreds of thousands of processors common in high performance computing environments.

In contrast to most other numerical methods, the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite element method retains exceptional stability on extremely coarse meshes.
DPG is also inherently very adaptive.
It is possible to compute the residual error without knowledge of the exact solution, which can be used to robustly drive adaptivity.
This results in a very automated technology, as the user can initialize a computation on the coarsest mesh which adequately represents the geometry 
then step back and let the program solve and adapt iteratively until it resolves the solution features.

A common complaint of minimum residual methods by computational fluid dynamics practitioners is that they are not locally conservative.
In this thesis, this concern is addressed by developing a locally conservative DPG formulation by augmenting the system with Lagrange multipliers.
The resulting DPG formulation is then proved to be robust and shown to produce superior numerical results over standard DPG
on a selection of test problems.

Adaptive convergence to steady incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes solutions 
was explored in \cite{JesseDissertation} and \cite{NateDissertation}.
Space-time offers a natural extension to transient problems as it preserves the stability and adaptivity properties of DPG
in the time dimension.
Space-time also offers more extensive parallelization capability than problems treated with traditional time stepping
as it allows multigrid concurrently in both space and time.
A proof of concept space-time DPG formulation is developed for transient convection-diffusion. 
The robust test norms derived for steady convection-diffusion are extended to the space-time case and proofs of robustness are provided.
Numerical results verify the robust behavior and near $L^2$ optimality of the resulting solutions.

The space-time formulation for convection-diffusion is then extended to transient incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes by analogy.
Several numerical experiments are performed, but a mathematical analysis is not attempted for these nonlinear problems.
Several side topics are explored such as a study of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations under various variable transformations
and the development of consistent test norms through the concept of physical entropy.

% Multiphase flow is a familiar phenomenon from daily life and occupies an important role in physics, engineering, and medicine. The understanding of multiphase flows relies largely on the theory of interfaces, which is not well understood in many cases. To date, the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations \cite{Korteweg1901,Waals1979} and the Cahn-Hilliard equation \cite{Cahn1958} have represented two major branches of phase-field modeling. The Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations describe a single component fluid material with multiple states of matter, e.g., water and water vapor; the Cahn-Hilliard type models describe multi-component materials with immiscible interfaces, e.g., air and water. In this dissertation, a unified multiphase fluid modeling framework is developed based on rigorous mathematical and thermodynamic principles. This framework does not assume any ad hoc modeling procedures and is capable of formulating meaningful new models with an arbitrary number of different types of interfaces.

% In addition to the modeling, novel numerical technologies are developed in this dissertation focusing on the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations. First, the notion of entropy variables is properly generalized to the functional setting, which results in an entropy-dissipative semi-discrete formulation. Second, a family of quadrature rules is developed and applied to generate fully discrete schemes. The resulting schemes are featured with two main properties: they are provably dissipative in entropy and second-order accurate in time. In the presence of complex geometries and high-order differential terms, isogeometric analysis \cite{Hughes2005} is invoked to provide accurate representations of computational geometries and robust numerical tools. A novel periodic transformation operator technology is also developed within the isogeometric context. It significantly simplifies the procedure of the strong imposition of periodic boundary conditions. These attributes make the proposed technologies an ideal candidate for credible numerical simulation of multiphase flows.

% A general-purpose parallel computing software, named \texttt{PERIGEE}, is developed in this work to provide an implementation framework for the above numerical methods. A comprehensive set of numerical examples has been studied to corroborate the aforementioned theories. Additionally, a variety of application examples have been investigated, culminating with the boiling simulation. Importantly, the boiling model overcomes several challenges for traditional boiling models, owing to its thermodynamically consistent nature. The numerical results indicate the promising potential of the proposed methodology for a wide range of multiphase flow problems.
