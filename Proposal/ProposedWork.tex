\chapter{Proposed work}
The completed work in 1D space-time has been very promising, but there is still much to do. 
Obviously 1D computations are not going to be sufficient, but we are in active development extending our code
to higher dimensional problems.
The results for Sod and Noh suggest that the current method is not entirely robust in terms of shrinking viscosity,
so we need to perform a robustness analysis and develop new test norms for transient convection-diffusion.
We will then extend these ideas to the more complicated case of Navier-Stokes.
Along the way I will be verifying our code on a number of standard benchmark problems for compressible and incompressible Navier-Stokes.
A summary of my contributions divided into areas A, B, and C of the CSEM program follow.
