\chapter{Proposed work}
In this chapter we outline the proposed work of solving the Navier-Stokes equations with space-time DPG. 
Our emphasis will be on incompressible Navier-Stokes, but time permitting, we would like to investigate the compressible equations as well.


\section{Space-time DPG for 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes}
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a Newtonian fluid in conservation form are
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial\bfu}{\partial t}+\Div\LRp{\bfu\otimes\bfu-\nu\Grad\bfu+p\bfI}&=\bff\\
  \Div\bfu&=0\,,
  % \int_\Omega p&=0
\end{align*}
where $\bfu$ is the fluid velocity, $p$ is the pressure, and $\bff$ is the forcing. 
This is to be solved on a space-time domain $\Omega\times[t_0,T]$.
Note that the pressure component of a solution will only be unique up to a constant. 
As a result, we impose a zero mean condition on the pressure: $\int_\Omega p=0$.

\subsection{Derivation of Space-Time DPG formulation}
The subsequent derivation is for spatially 2D flow, but 1D and 3D are very similar.
Following standard procedure, we write
