\chapter{Implicit Time Stepping with DPG}
The proposed research into space-time DPG does not imply that DPG is incompatible with other time integration techniques. 
We did spend some time exploring popular alternatives such as some singly diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta methods 
before we ultimately concluded that a space-time formulation might more naturally fit with our adaptive techniques.
In this chapter, we briefly outline some of our exploratory work on implicit time integrators with DPG.
