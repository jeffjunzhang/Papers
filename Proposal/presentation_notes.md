# Proposal Presentation Notes
## Motivation
### Dual Minimum Residual Method
Generalization of least squares
Riesz map is an isometry

### Optimal Petrov-Galerkin Methods
Minimum residual methods produce symmetric positive-definite stiffness matrices (backup slide)

### The Most Stable Petrov-Galerkin Method
If continuous problem is well-posed, OPG will be as well

### The Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Method
Easier to see with a concrete example (convection-diffusion)
