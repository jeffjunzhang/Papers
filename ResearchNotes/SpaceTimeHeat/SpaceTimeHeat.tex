\title{Notes on Space-Time for the Heat Equation}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

For the following discussion, let (master) element $K$ be a tensor product of a spatial
component, $X$, and a time component, $T$. Let $\Grad$ denote the spatial
gradient, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ denote the time derivative.

The heat equation is
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\epsilon\Delta u=f
\]
As a first order system, this is
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{\epsilon}\bfsigma-\Grad u&=0\\
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\Div\bfsigma&=f
\end{align*}
From this formulation, we can deduce that
\[
u,\bfsigma,\Grad u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\Div\bfsigma\in L^2
\]
If we view $\{-\bfsigma,u\}:=\mathbf{U}$ as a group variable, then the last
condition tells us that $\mathbf{U}\in H(\mathrm{div},K)$. In particular, this
means that across a constant time interface (horizontal lines in Figure 1 and
horizontal planes in Figure~\ref{fig:trace3D}), the normal component, $u$ should be continuous.

If we take the typical volume-centered, face-centered, edge-centered,
node-centered approach, then we can see that $u$ should have a volume-centered
component, all face-centered components, and edge-centered components on
non-horizontal edges. Of course, when we move to the DPG formulation, $u$
takes only the volume-centered basis, while the trace $\hat u$ takes
everything else.

Let $\mathbf{n}=(\mathbf{n_x},n_t)^T$ be the full space-time normal vector
where $\mathbf{n_x}$ is the spatial component and $n_t$ is the temporal
component.

Multiplying by test functions $\bftau$ and $v$, and integrating by parts
\begin{align*}
-\LRp{u,\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}}
+\LRa{\hat u,v\cdot n_t}
+\LRp{\bfsigma,\Grad v}
-\LRa{\widehat{\bfsigma\cdot\mathbf{n_x}}, v}\\
+\LRp{\frac{1}{\epsilon}\bfsigma,\bftau}
+\LRp{u,\Div\bftau}
-\LRa{\hat u,\bftau\cdot\mathbf{n_x}}
=\LRp{f,v}
\end{align*}

Let's examine these terms one at a time. Volume terms 1, 3, 5, and 6 are just
as they are for pure spatial DPG with the exception that vector quantities are
of the dimension of the spatial dimension only. Term 2 will degenerate on
constant space (as a function of time, vertical) boundaries. Terms 4 and 7 will
degenerate on constant time (as a function of space, horizontal) boundaries.

Now we analyze each variable in turn. It is easy to see that $u$ is a simple
scalar valued, volume-centered $L^2$ variable on each space-time element.
$\bfsigma$ is a vector valued, volume-centered $\mathbf{L}^2$ variable with
dimension equal to the spatial dimension.

Now for the trace and flux variables. $\hat u$ is probably the most
complicated variable in the system. It will obviously have face-centered
components on all faces, but it also needs to maintain full connectivity in
spatial directions, necessitating the need for edge-centered components on
non-horizontal edges. The face-centered bases have support only on a shared
face between two elements. The edge-centered bases on the other hand have
support on all faces connected to that edge. $\hat f$ is much simpler by
comparison. It only has scalar face-centered components on non-horizontal
faces.

Finally, we need to discuss the test functions. $v$ will need to be full
$H^1(K)$, while $\bftau$ will need to live in a tensor product space
$H(\mathrm{div},X)\times L^2(T)$.
