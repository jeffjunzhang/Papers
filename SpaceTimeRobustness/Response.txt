I read the paper by T. Ellis, J. Chan, and L. Demkowicz. I think the paper addresses
an interesting issue, and the results are interesting. On the other hand, I believe
that the paper has a few rought spots that need clarification/correction, and also that
it should have a written in a wider sense than the one it is currently written, especially
considering that it is aimed at appearing in a survey volume like the one you are editing.
Then, I detail now what are my main suggestions for this paper:

1. Make, possibly in the concluding remarks, some comments on the relationship this
work has with HdG, and also with multiscale FEM. I definitely think there is a connection
between the approaches, and then I would encourage the authors to make this connection
explicit (for example, the propeties of broken test functions in S 2.2.4 are very similar
to the properties of Multiscale basis functions)

A discussion of how DPG relates to multiscale methods and HDG has been added to the introduction.

2. In the problem presentation, is the convective field \beta a time-dependent function?
If so, there is clearly an overlap between the distinct components of the boundary of Q.
This might have an impact in the boundary conditions chosen.

LD will answer.

3. In equation (3), I believe there is a boundary term missing (this term is then present
in (4), containing a numerical flux)

The boundary terms are built into the test functions in equation (3).

4. I think the first paragraph in page 6 should be in the introduction. It states the main
idea of the paper, so....

We decided to maintain this paragraph in its current place, but added a couple sentences 
to the introduction covering these ideas.

5. Also in page 6, could the authors give some extra motivation on the inclusion of the
L^2 norm of u in the norm? It doesn't seem to come directly from the formulation. Also,
am I correct in supposing that, unless this term is included in the norm, the local problems
appearing by using the broken norms given in (7) and (8) would not be well-posed?

LD will answer.

6. Could the authors include some more comments in their proofs? They seem to be correct,
and they follow somehow familiar arguments, but still I believe some more details should
be given on how we go from one point to the next one. Also, some comments on how to
link one result to the following one would be welcome, just to make the paper easier
to read

We added comments to make following the proofs a little easier.

7. At the end of Section 3 the authors could give some comments on what is the significance
of the previous results. In particular, do they lead, naturally, to an error estimate of the method?

A couple lines were added at the end of Section 3 to summarize.

8. The legends in the plots are barely readable. Can the authors please make them clearer?
Also, it could be interesting to see an elevation of a numerical solution containing a boundary,
or inner, layer.

Fixed.

9. Finally, there are several typos and inconsistencies in the references. Please unify the format,
and order them alphabetically.

Fixed.
